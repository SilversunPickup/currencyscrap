# Basic information

This Scraper exists mainly to fetch financial currency data from the API endpoint of the fixer.io website of the European Central Bank and store them in a csv file. Data is updated daily.

Since spring 2018, a login is required to consume data from the API.

Account can be created for free here: https://fixer.io/


## Frequent update of data

A cronjob is highly recommended if you wanna feed your Data Warehouse on a frequent base.
