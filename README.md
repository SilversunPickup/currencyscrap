This Scraper exists mainly to fetch financial currency data from the API of the fixer.io website of the European Central Bank and store them in a file.

Since spring 2018, a login is required to consume data from the API.

Account can be created here: https://fixer.io/



A cronjob is highly recommended if you wanna feed your Data Warehouse.
